peb (Php-Erlang Bridge) is an open-source php extension to run php as an
Erlang cnode.

It's similar to the traditional php mysql function, you can communicate
with Erlang node easy.

Installation:

Run the following commands:
phpize
./configure --help
./configure
make
make install

Note:
  You can specify the location of both Erlang interface libraries
  and Erlang interface header files by using --with-erlang=DIR. The
  configure script will look for libraries and headers in DIR/lib and
  DIR/include respectively.
  In case libraries and headers do not share a common parent directory,
  use --with-erlanglib=LIB and --with-erlanginc=INCLUDE instead.
